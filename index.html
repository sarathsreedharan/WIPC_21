                    The International Planning Competition (IPC) is held every
                    few years in the context of ICAPS. It empirically evaluates
                    state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark
                    problems. The goals of the IPC are to promote planning
                    research, highlight challenges in the planning community and
                    provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks for
                    future research. The IPC has an important role in the ICAPS
                    community, being a forum to compare different algorithmic
                    ideas and implementations, and setting standards for
                    research and evaluation in the area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similar to the lineage of IPC workshops organised at ICAPS
                    2003, 2007, 2012, 2015, and 2019 this workshop aims to
                    review the current status of the IPC, analyse the results of
                    the last IPC (2020), and provide a venue for discussing
                    aspects that will be helpful for preparing forthcoming
                    competitions.

                  <h3>Topics</h3>
                  <p>Topics include, but need not be limited to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Past, present and future of the IPC</li>
                    <li>
                      Tracks: Proposing new and/or revising the current tracks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Domain Definition Languages: benefits and limitations.
                      Should larger subsets of PDDL/RDDL/HDDL be considered in
                      next editions of the IPC? Should the input languages
                      evolve in some way?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Benchmark Domains: Discussion/Analysis of existing
                      domains. Are IPC benchmarks a good standard for evaluation
                      of planners? How should instances be chosen for the
                      competition? Should there be randomly generated instances?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Evaluation Metrics: Should we adapt the metrics used for
                      evaluating the performance of planners? How should the
                      winners of the competition be decided (e.g. analysis of
                      advantages and disadvantages of IPC 2018 & 2020 vs.
                      SPARKLE Planning challenge 2019)?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Results: interpretation of past results, new ideas about
                      how to analyze/compare the performance of planners beyond
                      the score of the competition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Rules: Should portfolios be given a special treatment?
                      Should there be any limits on re-using code from others?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Tools: Can we automate large parts of the IPC to make
                      organising an IPC track easier?
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Submissions</h3>

                  <p>
                    We encourage submissions in three formats. All submissions
                    should be accompanied by a paper in AAAI style (the author
                    kit is available at
                    https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit21.zip
                    ). In all tracks you can choose the length of your
                    submission freely between 1-8 pages + one page for
                    references. Please choose a length appropriate for the
                    format of your submission.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      long presentations have a 30 minute slot, including
                      discussions. We expect most papers for this format will
                      make use of all 8 pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      short presentations have a 15 minute slot, including
                      discussions. We expect the average paper in this format
                      will have around 4 pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      super-short presentations have a 5 minute slot, including
                      discussion. We expect submissions to consist of an idea
                      that can be presented on 1-2 slides but lead to some
                      discussion, like a suggestion for a new track or metric.
                      Submissions in this track should consist of a title and
                      abstract, so no PDF submission is required (though it is
                      also welcomed).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    As suggested by the list of topics, we encourage the
                    submission of position papers as well as other submissions
                    that do not fit the mold of a typical conference paper.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The review process will be double blind. Submissions must be
                    made via easychair (<a
